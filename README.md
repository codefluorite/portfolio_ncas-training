# NCAS data science course exercises #

This is the repo for the NCAS Introduction to Data Science course that I completed during November 2018.

This course uses cf-python and cf-plot installed in a Linux environment and uses Jupyter notebook for execution of data and plots. 

Topics include:

* Importing and reading information inside NetCDF files.
* Extracting specific dates from a dataset. 
* Creating plots from selected information in a dataset. 
* Creating contour plots.
* Regridding information.
* Applying and altering colour scales to the plot data. 

Each jupyter notebook file can be downloaded from this repo.
